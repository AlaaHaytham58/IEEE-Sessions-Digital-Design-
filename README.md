# IEEE-Sessions-Digital-Design-
IEEE-Sessions and assignments (Covering Digital Design)
🧭 Overview
This repository documents my work and learning from the IEEE-led Digital Integrated Circuit (IC) Design Sessions. It includes RTL (Register-Transfer Level) designs, synthesis results, schematic analyses, and layout references, where applicable. The purpose is to build a strong foundation in CMOS digital design, HDL coding (primarily Verilog), and ASIC design flow fundamentals.

📚 Key Learning Objectives
Understand and implement combinational and sequential digital circuits at the RTL level.

Explore the ASIC design flow, including:

RTL design using Verilog

Functional simulation

Logic synthesis

Timing and area analysis

Gain exposure to EDA tools used in the industry.

🧠 Topics Covered
✅ Verilog HDL Syntax & Semantics

🔁 FSM Design (Mealy/Moore)

⌛ Pipelining & Timing Optimization

🔍 Functional vs Structural Modeling

📐 RTL-to-Gates Synthesis

🛠️ Gate-level Simulation & Netlist Analysis

🧮 Adders, Multipliers, Counters, ALUs

🛠️ Tools and Environments
